This project analyses the app store analytics provided by companies like App Annie or Sensor Tower that helps inform development and app marketing strategies for many companies.

I will compare thousands of apps in the Google Play Store so that we can gain insight into:
- How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are
- Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity
- How many downloads you would give up by making your app paid vs. free
- How much you can reasonably charge for a paid app
- Which paid apps have had the highest revenue
- How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue
